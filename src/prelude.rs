//! The desim prelude.
//!
//! The prelude is a list of things that you can import into your program with a single `use`.
//! It includes types which are used in almost every desim simulation program.
//!
//! To use the prelude in your simulation simply add in your source
//! ```rust
//! use desim::prelude::*;
//! ```
//!
//! You can find this used in some example programs in the `examples`
//! directory of the desim repository.
